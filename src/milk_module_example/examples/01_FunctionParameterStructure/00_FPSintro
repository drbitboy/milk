exampleDescription="
FPS is a structure holding function parameters, held in shared memory.

FPSs are specific to milk functions. Their content matches the function
set of parameters. They are created and managed by the functions:
There is no way to add/remove entries in an FPS other than changing the
source code for the function.

FPSs only exist in shared memory - they do not exist as regular files
on the filesystem.
